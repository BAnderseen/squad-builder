# HamKam Squad Builder
A randomised squad builder to put together a dream HamKam team, consisting of current and previous players, staff and misc. 

## How it works
The user is prompted to select a username, team name and formation for their team. Then they will be given 5 random players per position (based on their formation) to choose from. After picking 11 players, a captain will be selected. Then the players is prompted to select a coach, extra staff member, arena, sponsor and snacks to be served at home games. In the end the squad as a whole will be evaluated and rated. The squad builder ends on a results page where the user will have the option to start over.
